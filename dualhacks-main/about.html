<h4 style="text-align: center;, font-weight: bolder;">What is the financial literacy calculator?</h4>
<p>This is a calculator that conveys basic concepts of proper finances through deducting taxes and savings money, with the total amount representing the remainder left for personal needs and use. This serves as a positive outlet towards transparency through unknown territory that everyone has to face as they age. Real-life circumstances and business are often neglected in schools, and is typically ignored, leaving graduates lacking proper financial knowledge having to fend for themselves. Therefore, it is a quick and simple fun calculator that aids everyone. Here, we believe that everyone no matter their financial situation should  Try it out by putting in the monthly budget from your potential future career out of the median salary or from arbitrary values. 
<br />
This calculator runs based on the <strong>70/20/10 budgeting system</strong>, with 70% going towards your needs, 20% going towards taxes, and 10% going towards savings. The 70/20/10 system is known for being renowned and its more realistic take on a predecessor: the 50/30/20 system. The difference is that it does all the hard work for you, leaving you with a monthly plan, all for free.
