# financial-literacy-calc
Hi, so the general premise of this calculator was to sort of make learning finances easier and much quicker and give everyone accessible access to budget control without having to pay. 
Lots of students go their entire 10 or so years in lower-education with a total lack of education about finances. Already a huge problem, right? The American school system, and probably
much more than just *that* has numerous problems. One of the main ones is how students totally lack skills they need in the real world in the name of learning "more important" things 
that they probably won't ever utilize. So they're truly thrown to the wolves after high school, once they turn 18 and are no longer minors. Hopefully, this calculator, which also comes
with a general Q&A about general tax terms and filing taxes, will help out a little bit. Coding this was definitely a huge challenge because obviously I kind of suck rn and I'm still 
a beginner (if you can't tell from the coding), but it was very fun! Enjoyed it a lot. Thank you DualHacks for hosting this hackathon!
